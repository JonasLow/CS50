# Jonas' projects!

**Self-Introduction**

Greetings, I'm Jonas, a Chemical Engineering undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who is passionate about coding. The Design Your Own Course (DYOC) program at NUS has provided me with an opportunity to explore my interest in computer science, sponsoring my enrollment in the CS50 courses.

I am interested in deepening my knowledge of Computer Science, particularly in Python and C-programming languages. I aspire to one day become a successful data scientist or data analyst. However, I also am a firm believer in the central dogma: "Money is King". I intend to use what little knowledge I learn from my Computer Science journey and implement it to engineer a lucrative career in Quantitative Finance or Investment Analyst.

One day... Some day...
