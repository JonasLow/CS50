**Self-Introduction**

Greetings, I'm Jonas Low, a passionate undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My academic journey has led me to a unique opportunity – participation in the Design Your Own Course (DYOC) program at NUS, which has provided me with a platform to explore my interest in computer science and software development. This README is dedicated to explaining a project close to my heart – a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to manage and calculate shared expenses among participants.

**Project Overview**

At the heart of my GitHub repository lies a handy payment management tool that simplifies the process of managing shared expenses. Whether you're planning a trip with friends or collaborating on a project, keeping track of who owes what can be quite a challenge. My project aims to address this common issue and make the process more streamlined.

**Methodology**

Here's a quick overview of how this tool works:

Get Participants: The first step involves identifying who will be part of the shared expenses. This user-friendly tool allows you to input the names of the participants, making it easy to keep track of who is involved.

Input Transactions: After we've established who's in, we need to record the financial transactions. The tool accepts input in the format of "who paid" and "$(amount)". These transactions can be as simple as splitting a dinner bill or more complex financial interactions.

Calculate Nett Amount: The magic happens in this phase. The tool calculates the nett amount owed or to be received by each individual. It takes into account the total expenses and fairly distributes the financial burden among participants.

**Motivation Behind the Project**

This project originally stemmed from my participation in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, which sparked my curiosity and passion for software development. As an undergraduate student, I wanted to create something practical and useful, which led to the birth of this payment management tool.

**The DYOC Program**

The DYOC program at NUS has been an invaluable experience in my academic journey. It has provided me with the resources, and opportunities needed to explore my interests in computer science. This project serves as a testament to the skills and knowledge I've gained through the program.

**Conclusion**

In summary, my payment management tool is a practical solution for anyone dealing with shared expenses. It streamlines the process of tracking payments, ensuring that each participant's contributions are accurately accounted for. This project is not just an application of technical knowledge; it's a manifestation of my dedication to learning and growing as a software developer.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. I hope you find it as helpful as I do, and please feel free to contribute or offer feedback. If you have any questions or would like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out.
